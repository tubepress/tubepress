TubePress adds dynamic and interactive video features to websites. It’s highly configurable and designed for website
builders and users of any skill level. A typical use of TubePress is to embed a video gallery into a web page.

TubePress is available both as a downloadable package and via several cloud-hosted, zero-installation services.
The software is largely open sourced, and it’s designed and maintained by [TubePress LLC](http://tubepress.com/),
a software company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
